The famed Paris-Dakar race (no longer between Paris and Dakar by the way) will see competitors of the off-road endurance voyage start from Asuncion in Paraguay to reach Buenos Aires in Argentina 12 days later. The once again grueling itinerary of 9,000 kilometers will include several different weather patterns, high altitude passages, and timed sections. Shifting dunes in Bolivia have been announced on the program. The cargo vessel Grande Francia has crossed the Atlantic in three weeks to bring 600 vehicles from Le Havre to South America - organization, media, race and assistance included. Cars, trucks over 7,716 lb, motorcycles, and four-wheelers quads are the only four types of vehicles allowed to enter the race. There is a winner in each category. This year a new sub-category is added for lighter cars (SSV). The 2017 edition will see 491 competitors of 69 nationalities for 316 vehicles in the race. Many vehicle manufacturers exploit the harsh environment the rally offers as a testing ground to demonstrate the durability of their vehicles, although most vehicles are heavily modified or purpose built. Extreme weather patterns will be crossed this year, from intense heat to snow, rain, altitude winds and other clement and inclement nature behavior.  The Dakar Rally compensates 100 % of its carbon footprint. The Dakar's carbon emissions linked to reconnaissance trips, organization, competition, transport and logistics have been completely offset for the last six years by an active participation in the Madre de Dios environmental project. By fighting against the deforestation of the Peruvian part of the Amazon region, the Madre de Dios project has been able to save some 120,000 hectares of forest. An assessment is carried out after each bivouac and waste sorting is set up with authorized local companies. Aluminium, cardboard and paper, glass, oil, filters, tires and mechanical parts are processed and nothing harmful to the environment is left behind. Security is prime. Some 22,000 personnel (gendarmes, police, and military) are specially assigned for the security of the public and the rally, including in the 51 secured spectator zones along the odyssey. A field hospital, an air ambulance, seven helicopters, 32 wheeled vehicles including 10 paramedic vehicles, and a 60-person nursing staff will be at the ready alongside all participants.  Only one day of rest. An entire week will be spent at an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,850 feet.) Here is the complete itinerary: 2 Jan. Asuncion-Resistencia: 454 km (39 km timed against the watch) 3 Jan. Resistencia-San Miguel de Tucuman: 803 km (275 km timed - 284 for trucks) 4 Jan. San Miguel de Tucumn - San Salvador de Jujuy: 780 km (364 km timed - 199 for trucks) 5 Jan. San Salvador de Jujuy - Tupiza: 521 km (416 km timed) 6 Jan. Tupiza -Oruro: 692 km (447 km timed - 438 for trucks)7 Jan. Oruro - La Paz:786 km (527 km timed - 513 for trucks)9 Jan. La Paz - Uyuni: 622 km (322 km timed)10 Jan. Uyuni - Salta: 892 km (492 km timed)11 Jan. Salta - Chilecito: 977 km (406 km timed)12 Jan. Chilecito - San Juan: 751 km (449 km timed)13 Jan. San Juan - Rio Cuarto: 754 km (288 km timed)14 Jan. Rio Cuarto - Buenos Aires: 786 km (64 timed)  The original raid. The Dakar Rally also known as the Paris-Dakar Rally is an annual race organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation. Most events since its inception in 1978 were from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal. Due to security threats in various parts of the desert countries, the race since 2009 has been held in South America. It is open to amateur and professional entries, with the amateur category making up about eighty percent of the participants.

They stood at 5'10, wore necklaces and ate mammoth, bears, fish, insects, and horses. Our ancestors the Cro-magnons men, the very first modern humans left us traces of their art and way of life. They made weapons and jewelry with shells, bone, and animal teeth. The weather was harsh (ice age) so they took refuge in caves and created beautiful art. No fox hole. On one fateful day in 1940, four teenagers fooling around some hilly slopes in the Dordogne province of France, possibly to eye some foxes, came upon an opening in the earth. They did not know yet that their priceless discovery was more important to the human race than anything that was seen before. What they found in the valley of La Vézère was 19,000 to 20,000 years old. Drawings and engravings in the rocks above their heads and alongside seemingly endless corridors. The traces left behind by fellow humans from a very long time ago. They left us proofs and images of their daily lives and struggles. That same year, the site was declared a national landmark. The Lascaux cave is one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century. The cave displays paintings from the Paleolithic era of some 2,000 figures of men and animals in several shades of red, yellow and black, created by mineral pigments. They showed us how and what they ate, how they hunted, what their daily animals were and the battles they fought.   The first original paintings of the human kind. The entrance to the cave (used always in the singular form, not the caves) starts at an altitude of 185 meters, overlooking the valley floor. The shape of the cave hints that there were several entrances. The total length of the accessible parts is 235 meters and is divided into seven sectors: the Hall of the Bulls, the Axial Gallery, the Passageway, the Nave, the Chamber of the Felines, the Apse, and the Shaft. In 1947, work began to make the cave accessible to the public. The blocked entrance was redefined and the cone of earth and rocks that had acted as a thermal buffer, cushioning the effects of the external climate on the air inside, was eliminated. A bronze door was installed to close the site, as well as steps to ease down the way to the Hall of the Bulls. The cave floors were lowered to create an itinerary and lighting was installed alongside it. The cave opened to the public on July 14, 1948. In 1959 an air-conditioning system was installed. The discovery of some sort of green disease developing on the rocks led to the closure of the cave to the general public in 1963, as fear of human over-frequentation was polluting the environment.  Lascaux II. In 1972, rights were granted for the creation of a replica to accommodate the high number of visitors' demands to witness the extraordinary legacy seen at the cave. An old nearby quarry, which was already partly underground, was chosen as the future site, baptized Lascaux II. It opened to visitors in 1983. This copy is replicating 90 percent of the cave. It has welcomed millions of visitors. The original Lascaux cave was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, along with all of the decorated caves in the surrounding Vézère valley. Lascaux III is a traveling exhibition since 2012 that has visited Bordeaux, Bruxelles, Paris, Genève, Chicago, Houston, Montréal; currently visiting South Korea, and then Japan. With reproductions, 3D exhibits and films, the show introduces the cave to all ages with impeccable impressions and informative displays.  Back to the past. Recreating the exact atmosphere inside the original cave, Lascaux IV is now completed and will offer this time a complete copy of the cave in its entire splendor. With the most advanced new techniques at their disposal, teams of scientists and rock specialists were able to copy-cat the exact figures and animals represented by our ancestors - with true colors and identical feel. At a cost of 66 million Euros, the 8,500 square meters new landscape building represents the totality of the cave. Yesterday, French president François Hollande inaugurated the new exhibit Lascaux IV, the complete copy (fac-similé in French) of the original cave, which was closed to the general public due to human contamination and damages in 1963. The official name for Lascaux IV is International Center of Parietal Art Montignac-Lascaux, it will open to the public on Dec. 15. (Parietal art is the scientific and archaeological term for artwork done on cave walls or large blocks of stone.)  To recap: 1/Lascaux, the original cave.2/Lascaux II, the incomplete copy of the original (90 percent), open to the public until now, set to be shut down this month and reserved for scholars or specific groups and researchers.3/Lascaux III is a travelling exhibit gone around the World's museums.4/Lascaux IV, the new digital and integral reproduction that will allow more in-depth discovery of the famous paintings.

On January 2, the hardest and longest road trip of all starts again. The famed Paris-Dakar race (no longer between Paris and Dakar by the way) will see competitors of the off-road endurance voyage start from Asuncion in Paraguay to reach Buenos Aires in Argentina 12 days later. The once again grueling itinerary of 9,000 kilometers will include several different weather patterns, high altitude passages, and timed sections. Shifting dunes in Bolivia have been announced on the program. The cargo vessel Grande Francia has crossed the Atlantic in three weeks to bring 600 vehicles from Le Havre to South America - organization, media, race and assistance included. Cars, trucks over 7,716 lb, motorcycles, and four-wheelers quads are the only four types of vehicles allowed to enter the race. There is a winner in each category. This year a new sub-category is added for lighter cars (SSV). The 2017 edition will see 491 competitors of 69 nationalities for 316 vehicles in the race. Many vehicle manufacturers exploit the harsh environment the rally offers as a testing ground to demonstrate the durability of their vehicles, although most vehicles are heavily modified or purpose built. Extreme weather patterns will be crossed this year, from intense heat to snow, rain, altitude winds and other clement and inclement nature behavior.  The Dakar Rally compensates 100 % of its carbon footprint. The Dakar's carbon emissions linked to reconnaissance trips, organization, competition, transport and logistics have been completely offset for the last six years by an active participation in the Madre de Dios environmental project. By fighting against the deforestation of the Peruvian part of the Amazon region, the Madre de Dios project has been able to save some 120,000 hectares of forest. An assessment is carried out after each bivouac and waste sorting is set up with authorized local companies. Aluminium, cardboard and paper, glass, oil, filters, tires and mechanical parts are processed and nothing harmful to the environment is left behind. Security is prime. Some 22,000 personnel (gendarmes, police, and military) are specially assigned for the security of the public and the rally, including in the 51 secured spectator zones along the odyssey. A field hospital, an air ambulance, seven helicopters, 32 wheeled vehicles including 10 paramedic vehicles, and a 60-person nursing staff will be at the ready alongside all participants.  Only one day of rest. An entire week will be spent at an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,850 feet.) Here is the complete itinerary: 2 Jan. Asuncion-Resistencia: 454 km (39 km timed against the watch) 3 Jan. Resistencia-San Miguel de Tucuman: 803 km (275 km timed - 284 for trucks) 4 Jan. San Miguel de Tucumn - San Salvador de Jujuy: 780 km (364 km timed - 199 for trucks) 5 Jan. San Salvador de Jujuy - Tupiza: 521 km (416 km timed) 6 Jan. Tupiza -Oruro: 692 km (447 km timed - 438 for trucks)7 Jan. Oruro - La Paz:786 km (527 km timed - 513 for trucks)9 Jan. La Paz - Uyuni: 622 km (322 km timed)10 Jan. Uyuni - Salta: 892 km (492 km timed)11 Jan. Salta - Chilecito: 977 km (406 km timed)12 Jan. Chilecito - San Juan: 751 km (449 km timed)13 Jan. San Juan - Rio Cuarto: 754 km (288 km timed)14 Jan. Rio Cuarto - Buenos Aires: 786 km (64 timed)  The original raid. The Dakar Rally also known as the Paris-Dakar Rally is an annual race organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation. Most events since its inception in 1978 were from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal. Due to security threats in various parts of the desert countries, the race since 2009 has been held in South America. It is open to amateur and professional entries, with the amateur category making up about eighty percent of the participants.

They stood at 5'10, wore necklaces and ate mammoth, bears, fish, insects, and horses. Our ancestors the Cro-magnons men, the very first modern humans left us traces of their art and way of life. They made weapons and jewelry with shells, bone, and animal teeth. The weather was harsh (ice age) so they took refuge in caves and created beautiful art. No fox hole. On one fateful day in 1940, four teenagers fooling around some hilly slopes in the Dordogne province of France, possibly to eye some foxes, came upon an opening in the earth. They did not know yet that their priceless discovery was more important to the human race than anything that was seen before. What they found in the valley of La Vézère was 19,000 to 20,000 years old. Drawings and engravings in the rocks above their heads and alongside seemingly endless corridors. The traces left behind by fellow humans from a very long time ago. They left us proofs and images of their daily lives and struggles. That same year, the site was declared a national landmark. The Lascaux cave is one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century. The cave displays paintings from the Paleolithic era of some 2,000 figures of men and animals in several shades of red, yellow and black, created by mineral pigments. They showed us how and what they ate, how they hunted, what their daily animals were and the battles they fought.   The first original paintings of the human kind. The entrance to the cave (used always in the singular form, not the caves) starts at an altitude of 185 meters, overlooking the valley floor. The shape of the cave hints that there were several entrances. The total length of the accessible parts is 235 meters and is divided into seven sectors: the Hall of the Bulls, the Axial Gallery, the Passageway, the Nave, the Chamber of the Felines, the Apse, and the Shaft. In 1947, work began to make the cave accessible to the public. The blocked entrance was redefined and the cone of earth and rocks that had acted as a thermal buffer, cushioning the effects of the external climate on the air inside, was eliminated. A bronze door was installed to close the site, as well as steps to ease down the way to the Hall of the Bulls. The cave floors were lowered to create an itinerary and lighting was installed alongside it. The cave opened to the public on July 14, 1948. In 1959 an air-conditioning system was installed. The discovery of some sort of green disease developing on the rocks led to the closure of the cave to the general public in 1963, as fear of human over-frequentation was polluting the environment.  Lascaux II. In 1972, rights were granted for the creation of a replica to accommodate the high number of visitors' demands to witness the extraordinary legacy seen at the cave. An old nearby quarry, which was already partly underground, was chosen as the future site, baptized Lascaux II. It opened to visitors in 1983. This copy is replicating 90 percent of the cave. It has welcomed millions of visitors. The original Lascaux cave was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, along with all of the decorated caves in the surrounding Vézère valley. Lascaux III is a traveling exhibition since 2012 that has visited Bordeaux, Bruxelles, Paris, Genève, Chicago, Houston, Montréal; currently visiting South Korea, and then Japan. With reproductions, 3D exhibits and films, the show introduces the cave to all ages with impeccable impressions and informative displays.  Back to the past. Recreating the exact atmosphere inside the original cave, Lascaux IV is now completed and will offer this time a complete copy of the cave in its entire splendor. With the most advanced new techniques at their disposal, teams of scientists and rock specialists were able to copy-cat the exact figures and animals represented by our ancestors - with true colors and identical feel. At a cost of 66 million Euros, the 8,500 square meters new landscape building represents the totality of the cave. Yesterday, French president François Hollande inaugurated the new exhibit Lascaux IV, the complete copy (fac-similé in French) of the original cave, which was closed to the general public due to human contamination and damages in 1963. The official name for Lascaux IV is International Center of Parietal Art Montignac-Lascaux, it will open to the public on Dec. 15. (Parietal art is the scientific and archaeological term for artwork done on cave walls or large blocks of stone.)  To recap: 1/Lascaux, the original cave.2/Lascaux II, the incomplete copy of the original (90 percent), open to the public until now, set to be shut down this month and reserved for scholars or specific groups and researchers.3/Lascaux III is a travelling exhibit gone around the World's museums.4/Lascaux IV, the new digital and integral reproduction that will allow more in-depth discovery of the famous paintings.
